Credits

GLEW was developed by Milan Ikits and Marcelo Magallon. They also perform
occasional maintainance to make sure that GLEW stays in mint condition.
Aaron Lefohn, Joe Kniss, and Chris Wyman were the first users and also
assisted with the design and debugging process. The acronym GLEW originates
from Aaron Lefohn. Pasi Krkkinen identified and fixed several problems with
GLX and SDL. Nate Robins created the wglinfo utility, to which modifications
were made by Michael Wimmer.
