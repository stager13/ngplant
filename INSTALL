python : http://www.python.org (only if you want to build it yourself)
scons:  http://www.scons.org   (only if you want to build it yourself)

If you want to build _ngp module (Python bindings to ngpcore high-level
interface) you will need python development files.

If you want to compile ngpview application you will need glut library.

To generate ngpcore API documentation xsltproc application
(http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html) is required. Note, that generated
documentation in html format is included in source package.

Building under GNU Linux (for Linux):

2. $ cd ngplant-X.X.X
3. $ scons

Building under GNU Linux (for Windows):
1. Untar source archive (ngplant-X.X.X.tar.gz)
2. $ cd ngplant-X.X.X
3. Edit file cross-sample.py located at config directory (or create new one)
   and set variables which describe your system setup. Do not
   forget to set variable "cross" to "yes".
4. $ scons config=<name_of_config>
